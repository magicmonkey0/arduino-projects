# arduino-projects

Experimenting with arduino uno.

This repository contains all of my Arduino projects, starting from the basics and gradually exploring more advanced circuits and sensors.

## Projects
- [Morse Code Blinker](morse-code-blink/) â€“ Blink "Hello World" in Morse code using the onboard LED
- [External Blinking LED](external-led-blink/) - Blinking an External LED using a breadboard
- [Light Sensor LED](light-sensor-led/) - Detecting levels of light intensity using a photoresistor
- [Switching it Up](switching-it-up/) - Using switches to make an interactive circuit
- [Fading LEDs](fading-leds/) - Lighting up and fading different colours using RGB LED depending on light levels using a photoresistor and PWM
